# Mini Project ðŸ“±
**Author: Thomas Indrias**

For the mini project, I've decided to make a *shopping cart* and a *steps left progress bar* as packages. The language chosen is Flutter.

Respective packages are found at:
 - `shopping_cart/`
 - `steps_left/`

Getting started tutorial is found at `getting_started/README.md`.

### Tasks done
 - [x] Implement **shopping_cart**
 - [x] Implement **steps_left**
	 - [x] Widget testing
 - [x] Write a getting started guide
